          Depression is a low mood that lasts for a long time, affecting
          everyday life. It is often triggered by a mix of genetic,
          psychological and environmental factors; studies show that the risk of
          becoming depressed can be increased by life events such as poverty,
          the death of a loved one, physical illness, or abuse. For some, the
          risk is also hereditary.

              Persistent feelings of sadness are one of the symptoms of
              depression. However, depression also involves physical symptoms
              such as changes in appetite and quality of sleep, emotional
              symptoms such as feelings of worthlessness, and changes in
              behavior such as the loss of interest in our usual activities. For
              people experiencing depression, these symptoms continue for more
              than two weeks.

              Depression is not a sign of weakness but a medical condition.
              Depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain that can be
              treated. Depression is unrelated to the strength of someone s
              character; it is a serious medical condition like asthma or
              diabetes. Depression is often triggered by major life events that
              may be challenging to cope with, e.g., the loss of a loved one,
              the loss of a job, etc.
